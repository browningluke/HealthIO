# HealthIO: A mood, sleep and activity tracking app.

## Description and Personal Interest

My goal is to design a program that can track, store and visualize my mental health in a quantifiable way over time. There exist similar programs on Android that accomplish this, however they offer expensive 'premium' plans, store my personal data on their servers, and require me to use my phone to track it. I am looking to make a program that offers the ability to easily log how I am feeling at certain points throughout the day (on a 1-5 scale), with the ability to add optional data about what events I was doing around the time, visualize this data over a week and export it to a csv file for use in other programs.

This program aims to target two main types of people: 
- Those who have suffered/do suffer with varying moods, depression, any other mental health issue. 
- Those who like to micromanage and log as many aspects of their lives as they can.

I began looking for a program that offered these features a few years ago out of willingness to log and organize as many aspects of my life as I could, as well as a mild curiosity as to how my mental health progressed over time. However, since the outbreak of Covid-19, I have found myself experiencing a much greater range of moods than I did before, and would now greatly benefit from being able to track my moods, and the events linked to them, over a period of time. Since I have a few friends who have also had their mental health deteriorate as a result of the pandemic, I thought that I would take the opportunity to create this program I want as my *CPSC 210* project.
